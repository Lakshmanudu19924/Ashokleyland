📋 Project Description:

Title: Using Data Analytics to Increase the Efficiency of the Gearbox Machine Shop
Organization: Ashok Leyland
Role: Intern
Duration: Nov 2024 – Apr 2025.

This project was developed under Ashok Leyland as part of my internship, 
focusing on optimizing the Gearbox Machine Shop’s operational efficiency through data analytics and predictive modeling.
The system leverages Python, Streamlit, and Linear Regression to automate gearbox inventory control, 
forecast production demand, and provide actionable insights for manufacturing optimization. 
By replacing manual tracking methods with real-time analytics, the solution reduces downtime, 
minimizes overstocking, and streamlines production planning.

🎯 Objectives:
Automate gearbox inventory tracking and forecasting using data analytics.
Predict future gear demand through Linear Regression based on historical data.
Provide real-time decision support via an interactive Streamlit-based interface.
Improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and enhance production accuracy.

⚙️ System Features:
Excel Data Integration: Import and process dynamic Excel sheets containing gearbox production data.
Real-time Inventory Monitoring: Automatically update and track current stock levels.
Predictive Analysis: Utilize Linear Regression to forecast upcoming gearbox requirements.
Interactive Dashboard: Built using Streamlit to visualize real-time data trends.
Automated Alerts: Notify users when stock levels drop below thresholds.


🧠 Technical Approach:
The project applies a data-driven methodology that uses historical inventory and production data to forecast future needs.
Step 1: Import and clean Excel datasets using Pandas.
Step 2: Extract features such as daily production, stock level, and consumption rate.
Step 3: Apply Linear Regression to predict future gear requirements.
Step 4: Display results in real time through a Streamlit web app.
Step 5: Enable users to take data-backed decisions to optimize production.
